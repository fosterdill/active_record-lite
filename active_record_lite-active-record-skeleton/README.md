###ActiveRecord Lite

In this project I attempted to replicate the core features of the ActiveRecord ORM. I have implemented most of the basic functionality, including `find`, `where`, `update`, `insert`, and `all`. Also I added basic association support for `has_many` and `belongs_to`. While writing these I relied heavily on Rails' metaprogramming capabilities.
